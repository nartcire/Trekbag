## Motivation

I wanted to create this project to further hone the concepts learned in React.js while also learning about the React Context API and Zustand. I did not take part in the creation of the CSS file on this project and was exclusively focues on the React.js fundamentals along with other new technologies mentioned above.

## Description

A simple web application that allows the user to write down the stuff they need to pack for their next upcoming trip! Users are able to add and delete list items, and they can sort the items based off of complete/incompletion. The user can also quickly remove all the items from the list and revert the list back to its original state in the beginning for the demo. They can also mark all items as complete or incomplete if needed. Additionally, the items on the list are stored in localstorage thus it will continue to persist even if the user closes the web app and opens it again. Towards the end, I decided to not use the React Context API and opted for Zustand instead since the React Context API has an issue of re-rendering the components which would lead to worse performance.
